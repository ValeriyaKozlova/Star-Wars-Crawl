                It was a nice surprise that I was accepted to BeCode! It was a long road to decide to become a web-developer, but only in my mind, because when I definitely decided, I completed all steps in few last days before the deadline of BeCode. Then I had a very stressfull day of the selection, when I did a thing that I really hate - I spoke in front of many people (I hate it just because I worked in tourisme and I did it too often).  Finally, I got an e-mail that made me very happy: I found my way where I can  develop my abilities whithout speaking French perfectly. Also I hope that I will find a job very fast after BeCode. But now I am completely in the learning, and it's cool that I like it a lot, so I almost don't make a pause,and also I work on it at home. 
                In short, I see it's really my way!
